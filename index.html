<p>The pineapple (Ananas comosus) is a <u>tropical plant</u> with an edible multiple fruit consisting of <strong>coalesced berries</strong>,
  also called pineapples, and the most economically significant plant in the family Bromeliaceae.
Pineapples may be cultivated from the offset produced at the top of the fruit, possibly flowering in five to ten months and fruiting in the following six months.
Pineapples do not ripen significantly after harvest.
In 2016, Costa Rica, Brazil, and the Philippines accounted for nearly one-third of the world's production of pineapples.</p>
