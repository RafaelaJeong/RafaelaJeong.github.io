<p>The Pineapple is one of Scotland's most famous follies.  It is a huge stone replica of the fruit, beautifully carved to reproduce all the features of the real thing.  It sits on top of a garden pavilion erected in 1761 by John Murray, the 4th Earl of Dunmore, and stands some 45 feet above ground level on the south slope and 37 feet on the North.  The pineapple part was probably added around 1777 when the Earl returned to Scotland after serving as Governor of the colonies of New York and Virginia.  On the east coast of the American colonies the pineapple was a symbol of welcome and often the planters from the West Indies, who had big mansions in New York and New England, would place a real pineapple on their gate post as a sign that they were home and ready to receive visitors. Murray returned to the Americas after the War of Independence as Governor of the Bahamas wher pineapples were a major product.  It is just possible that the stone Pineapple was erected during or after his time there which would place it in the late 1780s or early 90s. </p>
